# Numbers-Game
 A numbers guessing game

## Description
A game in which the player tries to guess the number - which is randomly chosen from 1 - 100 at the start of each game - in the least number of guesses possible.

## Updates
- 12/28/21: After returning to this project to put it on my portfolio, I had the idea to make it so that players can use their keyboard to play if they want (because as of then, players were only able to play via clicking the Guess and Reset buttons with their mouse). To go ahead with simulating the "Guess" button, the player can press Enter. To simulate pressing the "Reset" button, the player can hit the D key.

## About This Project

### Building of the Numbers Game

The creation of this game began when I was searching for some projects to do to help me practice and strengthen my JavaScript skills.
